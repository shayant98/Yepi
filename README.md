Yepi is a one way social platform where people can come to release their inner thoughts and not get judged for it by staying anonymous. Yepi makes the process of seaking help or group sessions easy and frictionless.


## Social Diary
Yepi allows people to get the help they need by recording them in a private diary or publishing them on the public support board.

## Moodboard

### Inspiration

After reading about how many precious people in Suriname take their life, because of the **TABOO** around mental health issues and/or other reasons such as: lack of information or lack of support. The main goal is to help people open up about mental health in Suriname and remove the negative stigma surrounding it.
